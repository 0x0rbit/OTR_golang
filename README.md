# OTR_GO
This is the implementation of OTR protocol I did along with Jonathan Torchia and Rutwij Kulkarni in the Graduate level ISA 763 - Security Protocol Analysis class. You can see the report if you need more info on the protocol and results etc.

The requirements of the implementation are listed in Requirements file.
